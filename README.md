# DVD-rental-database-python
 
In this assignment, we utilize pandas to analyze the DVD rental database. To populate the dataframe, we establish a connection using SQLite and subsequently create the dataframe using `pd.read_sql`. Our code, found in `main.ipynb`, leverages functionalities from pandas, numpy, and SQL, and also features visualizations using matplotlib. The database can be accessed and downloaded from this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atanaskanev/sqlite-sakila-sample-database).
